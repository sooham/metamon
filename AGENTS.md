# Environments
The package manager in python here is `uv`. The development machine is a macbook pro M4 Pro with 1 TB of storage. Currently there is no production environement.

# Storage limitations of development machine 
Before running any commands which will generate a lot of files, check if the computer has enough free storage.

# Surveying the pokemon datasets directory
The pokemon datasets is in $METAMON_CACHE_DIR . when you look at subfolders in that be mindful because
the folders contain millions of files, using common bash commands like `ls`, `find` etc. will time out.
if the user has given you the exact battle id or filename , use that smogtours-gen1ou-749168_Unrated_encore90411_vs_mindplate96156_02-23-2024_WIN.json 
if you want to pick random battles or replay files , use `ls -f` in combination with tools like `head` or `tail` and others which are only going to read so many inodes in the folder.

# Asking the user for help
If you run into a bug i.e bad environment setups, an error you can't resolve, ambiguous references and error traces, please ask the user to clarify with more information.

# Tests and updating tests
The metamon repo has pytests tests , they can be run with `make test`. Analyzing if the test suite needs an updatee is mandatory. If you make critical changes or breaking changes you are expected to also update the tests. Your new test cases should be simple, composable and respect module and class boundaries. End2end tests  are in `uv run pytest tests/test_e2e_smoke.py tests/test_e2e_output.py -v` can combine multiple modules and classes to achive good test coverage. Mocking is done with monkeypatch if necessary.

# Performance
You should write code which if necessary and at your own discrection and determination of performance and runtime based on input size, should use parallelism such as threading , pooling, multi-process code if necessary, be mindful of shared resources and that functions being called are thread safe.  Other common perfomance optimizations include using caching in memory, writing to files for faster processing and reading from them on the next run are also good practices.

# Showdown Dex — the static Pokémon data layer

The `Dex` class (`metamon/backend/showdown_dex/dex.py`) is the **single source of truth** for canonical Pokémon game data in the codebase. It is adapted from the [poke-env](https://github.com/hsahovic/poke-env) library but Metamon maintains its own static JSON files with corrections for early generations.

### What it loads (per generation)

`Dex.from_gen(gen)` or `Dex.from_format("gen9ou")` loads five data files from `metamon/backend/showdown_dex/static/`:

| Data file | Contents | Key fields |
|---|---|---|
| `moves/gen{gen}moves.json` | All move definitions | type, power, accuracy, pp, category, priority, flags |
| `pokemon/gen{gen}pokedex.json` | All Pokémon species | name, baseSpecies, types, baseStats, abilities, requiredItem, requiredAbility, requiredTeraType, cosmeticFormes, num |
| `typechart/gen{gen}typechart.json` | Type effectiveness matrix | damageTaken mapping (0=immune, 1=2× resist, 2=½× resist, 3=normal) |
| `natures.json` | Stat-modifying natures (Gen 3+) | increased/decreased stat |
| `learnset.json` | Move learnsets per Pokémon | which Pokémon learn which moves |

### Key API

- **`Dex.from_gen(gen: int)`** — returns a cached `Dex` instance for that generation. Uses `@lru_cache` so repeated calls are free.
- **`Dex.from_format(format: str)`** — parses the generation from a format string (e.g., `"gen9ou"` → gen 9) and returns the corresponding `Dex`.
- **`dex.get_pokedex_entry(name: str)`** — looks up a Pokémon by its canonical (normalized) name. Raises `KeyError` if not found.
- **`dex.pokedex`**, **`dex.moves`**, **`dex.type_chart`** — direct access to the loaded dicts.

### Cross-generation fallback

When looking up a Pokémon that might not exist in the current gen's Pokédex (e.g., a Gen 9 species appearing in a Gen 9 format), the code searches **progressively higher** generation dex files (gen, gen+1, gen+2, …) until a match is found. This is implemented in `Pokemon._lookup_pokedex_info()` in `replay_state.py`.

### Where it's used

| Consumer | How it uses Dex |
|---|---|
| **Replay parser** (`replay_state.py`) | Looks up species name, types, base stats, abilities, required items, and Tera types when a Pokémon is first revealed during parsing |
| **RL environment** (`metamon_player.py`) | Gets the generation number from the battle format to configure the online battle |
| **Team construction** (`pokemon_pool.py`) | Looks up dex entries for ability resolution, required items, species clause enforcement (via `num`/`baseSpecies`), and base species deduplication |
| **Team prediction / usage stats** | Resolves species from usage data for team prediction models |

### Thread safety and instantiation

The `Dex` class uses `__slots__` and the constructor raises if a `Dex` for that gen already exists in `_gen_data_per_gen`. This means you should **always** use `Dex.from_gen()` (which caches) rather than calling `Dex(gen)` directly. The class is read-only after construction, making it safe to share across threads.

**Further reading:** The static JSON files live in `metamon/backend/showdown_dex/static/`. The cross-gen fallback logic is in `Pokemon._lookup_pokedex_info()` in `metamon/backend/replay_parser/replay_state.py`. For how the dex integrates with species clause in team construction, see `build_species_clause_keys()` in `metamon/backend/team_construction/pokemon_pool.py`.

# Raw replay format and the Showdown SIM-PROTOCOL

Raw replays are JSON files with a "log" field containing the battle transcript as a newline-separated string of **pipe-delimited messages** (`|type|arg1|arg2|...`). Each line's first token after the pipe is the message type, and the rest are arguments. This format is defined by the [Showdown SIM-PROTOCOL](https://github.com/smogon/pokemon-showdown/blob/master/sim/SIM-PROTOCOL.md).

Key message types the parser cares about (with concrete examples from real replays):
- `|player|p1|stick27544|224` — declares a player (avatar ID and rating are optional)
- `|poke|p1|Mimikyu, M|` — reveals a team member during team preview (item may be blank)
- `|switch|p1a: Jynx|Jynx|333/333` — a Pokémon switches in (also used for leads); HP in `cur/max` format, status optionally appended (e.g. `100/100 par`)
- `|move|p1a: Jynx|Lovely Kiss|p2a: Gengar` — a Pokémon uses a move; may include flags like `[miss]` or `[still]`
- `|-damage|p2a: Chansey|87/100` — HP change; `0 fnt` means fainted; can carry `[from] item: Life Orb` or `[from] ability: ...` tags
- `|faint|p2a: Exeggutor` — a Pokémon faints (triggers forced switch tracking)
- `|turn|1` — turn boundary (also triggers turn initialization)
- `|choice|move lovelykiss|move hypnosis` — reveals both players' clicks using **named** format (move names spelled out). Also found as numeric format: `|choice|switch 2|switch 4`. Can be empty: `|choice||`. Only present in some replays.
- `|win|hustle11937` or `|tie` — battle outcome
- `|replace|p1a: Zoroark|Zoroark|87/100` — Zoroark/Zorua's Illusion breaks, revealing the real Pokémon
- `|-status|p2a: Gengar|slp` — status condition applied; `|-curestatus|p1a: Slowbro|slp` removes it
- `|-boost|p1a: Slowbro|spa|2` — stat stage change; `|-unboost|p1a: Snorlax|spd|1` is the reverse
- `|-ability|p2a: Zamazenta|Dauntless Shield|boost` — ability activation; `|-endability|p1a: ...` deactivates
- `|-item|p1a: Scizor|Life Orb` — item revealed; `|-enditem|p2a: Glimmora|Focus Sash` means consumed/removed
- `|-sidestart|p1: confusion58079|move: Toxic Spikes` — side condition (entry hazard, screen, etc.) applied; `|-sideend` removes
- `|-weather|RainDance` — weather set; `|-weather|none` clears it
- `|-fieldstart|Electric Terrain` — field condition; `|-fieldend` removes
- `|-activate|p2a: Glimmora|ability: Toxic Debris` — catch-all for ability/item effects (Trick, Mimic, Berry consumption, etc.)
- `|-terastallize|p1a: Garganacl|Rock` — Gen 9 only; reveals Tera type
- `|-transform|p1a: Ditto|p2a: Gengar` — Transform (Ditto, Mew); user copies target's species
- `|drag|p2a: Chansey|Chansey|100/100` — forced switch-in from Roar / Dragon Tail / Circle Throw
- `|teamsize|p1|6` — declares team size (usually 6, can be fewer)
- `|gen|1` — generation number
- `|tier|[Gen 1] OU` — battle format
- `|rule|Sleep Clause Mod: Limit one foe put to sleep` — ruleset entry
- `|-sethp|p1a: Snorlax|100/100` — direct HP set (e.g. from Pain Split, Endeavor)
- `|-swapboost|p1a: ...|p2a: ...|[from] move: Heart Swap` — swaps stat boosts between two Pokémon
- `|-clearboost|p1a: Snorlax` — clears all stat boosts
- `|-start|p2a: Snorlax|Reflect` — volatile effect (Reflect, Leech Seed, Curse, etc.) applied; `|-end` removes
- `|cant|p1a: Slowbro|par` — a Pokémon can't move (paralysis, sleep, flinch, etc.)
- `|c|...` or `|chat|...` or `|-message|...` — chat messages (ignored by the parser)

Messages starting with `-` are "minor" protocol messages that describe side effects (damage, status, boosts, weather, items, abilities, etc.). The parser's `SimProtocol.IGNORES` set lists message types that are intentionally skipped (animations, chat, timers, redundant info like `-crit` and `-supereffective`).

The raw replays live in `$METAMON_CACHE_DIR/raw-replays/{gen}/{tier}/*.json`. Example: `smogtours-gen1ou-235844` is a Gen 1 OU replay with real `|choice|` messages like `|choice|move lovelykiss|move hypnosis` and `|choice|switch 2|switch 4`.

**Further reading:** The authoritative reference is [pokemon-showdown/SIM-PROTOCOL.md](https://github.com/smogon/pokemon-showdown/blob/master/sim/SIM-PROTOCOL.md). For line-by-line real-world examples, browse a few raw replay JSON files in `$METAMON_CACHE_DIR/raw-replays/` (use `ls -f | head` to pick a handful without listing millions of files). The `SimProtocol.IGNORES` set and `interpret_message()` dispatch table in `metamon/backend/replay_parser/forward.py` are the canonical list of which messages the parser handles and which it deliberately skips.

# Parser: forward fill, backward fill, and one-sided POV conversion

The replay parser (`metamon/backend/replay_parser/`) converts a **spectator-perspective** raw replay into two **one-sided** parsed trajectory files — one from each player's point of view (WIN and LOSS). This happens in three stages:

### 1. Forward fill (`forward.py`)
`SimProtocol` walks the raw log line-by-line via `interpret_message()`, maintaining full-knowledge game state in a `ParsedReplay` object (a list of `Turn` dataclasses). Each `Turn` holds both players' teams, active Pokémon, moves, conditions, weather, etc. The forward pass tracks everything a spectator would see — both players' full teams and actions. It also handles complex mechanics like forced switches (U-turn, Volt Switch, Eject Button, Red Card, Revival Blessing), Zoroark Illusion (`|replace|` messages), Transform, Mimic, and multi-turn/consecutive moves. The forward result is a complete battle transcript with all 12 Pokémon and their revealed info.

### 2. Backward fill (`backward.py`)
After the forward pass, a "final turn" is appended with both full teams filled in using a `TeamPredictor` (usage-stats-based guessing, or exact data from `|showteam|` messages). This filled turn is then propagated **backwards** through the trajectory via `backfill_info()`: each Pokémon in turn `t+1` contributes its known item, ability, moves, stats, etc. to the same Pokémon in turn `t`. This fills gaps where information wasn't revealed until later in the battle. The final turn is then discarded.

### 3. POV conversion
`POVReplay` takes the spectator `ParsedReplay` and the backward-filled copy, then:
- Overwrites one side's team with the filled version (`_fill_one_side`)
- Resolves Transform edge cases (`_resolve_transforms`) — copies moves learned during transformation backwards through the window
- Resolves Zoroark Illusion (`_resolve_zoroark`) — fixes action targets and movesets that were misattributed to the disguise Pokémon
- Aligns states and actions (`_align_states_actions`) — flattens turns+subturns into a timeline of `(state, action)` pairs for one player, with the action being what the player clicked at that state (from `moves_1`/`moves_2`, falling back to `choices_1`/`choices_2`)

The result is saved as two JSON files per raw replay — e.g. `gen1ou-370249571_Unrated_uturn10423_vs_tintedlens67414_02-23-2024_WIN.json` and the corresponding LOSS file. Each contains `{"states": [...], "actions": [...]}` in the Universal format.

### Key classes in the pipeline
- `ParsedReplay` / `Turn` / `Pokemon` / `Move` / `Action` (`replay_state.py`) — the in-memory battle state during parsing
- `SimProtocol` (`forward.py`) — the line-by-line log interpreter
- `POVReplay` (`backward.py`) — converts spectator state to one-sided POV
- `ReplayParser` (`parse_replays.py`) — orchestrates the full pipeline (forward → backward → save)
- `UniversalState` / `UniversalAction` / `UniversalPokemon` (`interface.py`) — backend-agnostic representations used by datasets and the RL env. These are what get serialized to disk and what the PyTorch datasets load.

**Further reading:** The core pipeline entry point is `ReplayParser.parse_replay()` in `metamon/backend/replay_parser/parse_replays.py` — read this first for the big picture. Then trace into `forward.forward_fill()` → `SimProtocol.interpret_message()`, and `backward.backward_fill()` → `POVReplay`. The validation checks in `metamon/backend/replay_parser/checks.py` document every invariant the forward and backward passes must maintain. Tests in `tests/test_forward_actions.py`, `tests/test_backward_structure.py`, and `tests/test_e2e_smoke.py` show the expected behavior. The parsed output format is consumed by `metamon/data/parsed_replay_dset.py` (PyTorch Dataset) and `metamon/env/metamon_battle.py` (online RL env), which both convert through `interface.py`'s `UniversalState`/`UniversalAction`.

# Action indexes in the Universal format

Every action a player can take is mapped to an integer **action index** between -1 and 12, as defined in `UniversalAction.from_ReplayAction()` in `metamon/interface.py`:

| Action Index | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **-1** | Missing / unknown action (the player's choice was never revealed — e.g. paralyzed, asleep, flinched, or Zoroark illusion confusion) |
| **0** | No-op or special move: Recharge (after Hyper Beam), Struggle (no PP left), or Fight (Gen 1's generic attack button) |
| **1–3** | **Moves** — up to 4 moves from the active Pokémon, sorted alphabetically for consistency |
| **4–8** | **Switches** — up to 5 benched Pokémon (non-active, non-fainted), sorted alphabetically |
| **9–12** | **Tera-boosted moves** — same as moves 0–3 but with the Tera gimmick active (Gen 9 only); action index = 9 + move_index |

The `DefaultActionSpace` uses `Discrete(13)` (indices 0–12). The `MinimalActionSpace` strips tera by mapping 9–12 back to 0–3, using `Discrete(9)`. The world model (`sl/model.py`) uses an embedding table of size 14 (action indices -1 through 12, remapped to 0–13 via `action_idx + 1`).

Legal action masking is done by `UniversalAction.maybe_valid_actions()`: during a forced switch, only switch indices (4–8) are legal; otherwise moves (0–3), tera moves (9–12 if `can_tera`), and switches (4–8) are all allowed.

**Further reading:** The authoritative definitions are in `metamon/interface.py` — `UniversalAction.from_ReplayAction()` (mapping raw actions → indices), `UniversalAction.maybe_valid_actions()` (legal masking), and `UniversalAction.action_idx_to_BattleOrder()` (index → online move selection). The two action spaces (`DefaultActionSpace`, `MinimalActionSpace`) are also in `interface.py`. For how indices are consumed by models, see `metamon/sl/model.py` (`action_embedding` with 14 entries) and `metamon/rl/train.py`. Tests in `tests/test_forward_actions.py` verify action invariants, and `checks.check_action_idxs()` in `metamon/backend/replay_parser/checks.py` validates index correctness per timestep.

# Team Preview — lead prediction model

The `TeamPreviewModel` (`metamon/backend/team_preview/preview.py`) is a **Perceiver-style neural network** that predicts which Pokémon to lead with at the start of a battle. It consumes parsed replays (Universal format) for training and is used at inference time by the RL evaluation system.

### Problem statement

At team preview, you see all 12 Pokémon (6 yours, 6 opponent's). You must pick one of your 6 to send out first. The model learns this from human gameplay data — for each parsed replay, the first state contains the team preview info and the player's actual lead choice (the first active Pokémon).

### Architecture

```
Inputs: 12 Pokémon tokens + optional additional info + format token
   │
   ├─ Token embeddings (nn.Embedding over PokemonTokenizer vocab)
   ├─ Positional embeddings (0–11 for the 12 Pokémon)
   ├─ Team embeddings (0=ours, 1=opponent)
   └─ Optional: additional info embeddings (moves, ability, item per our Pokémon)
   │
   ▼
Cross-Attention: latent tokens attend to the input sequence
   │
   ▼
Self-Attention: latent tokens attend to each other
   │
   ▼
LayerNorm + Flatten → Linear classifier → 6-way softmax
```

The learnable latent tokens (default 4) act as a bottleneck — they extract relevant information from the input sequence through cross-attention, then refine it through self-attention, and finally the classifier predicts over the 6 team slots.

### Input details

- **Team tokens:** 12 integers — our 6 Pokémon token IDs followed by opponent 6, both sorted alphabetically by `consistent_pokemon_order()` for consistency
- **Additional info (optional, per our Pokémon):** a 6-token vector: up to 4 moves (sorted alphabetically, padded with `<blank>`), ability token, item token. This gives the model knowledge of our own team's full sets, not just species names.
- **Format token (optional):** a single token like `<gen9ou>` to condition on the battle format

### Dataset

`TeamPreviewDataset` loads parsed replay JSON files from `$METAMON_CACHE_DIR/parsed-replays/{format}/`. For each replay it:
1. Reads the first `UniversalState` (team preview state)
2. Extracts our 6 Pokémon + opponent's 6 teampreview names
3. Tokenizes everything
4. Labels the lead index (which of our 6 sorted Pokémon is the active one)

It supports filtering by rating, result (wins/losses/both), and format.

### Training

`train_team_preview()` handles the full training loop:
- 95/5 train/val split
- Cross-entropy loss, AdamW optimizer
- Early stopping on validation accuracy (patience default 5 epochs)
- Saves `best_model.pt` and `latest_model.pt` checkpoints
- Optional W&B logging

### Inference API

```python
model = TeamPreviewModel.load_from_checkpoint("best_model.pt")
predicted_lead, probs, sorted_team = model.predict_lead(
    our_team=["Garchomp", "Rotom-Wash", ...],
    our_team_moves=[["Earthquake", "Swords Dance", ...], ...],
    our_team_abilities=["Rough Skin", ...],
    our_team_items=["Rocky Helmet", ...],
    opponent_team=["Landorus-Therian", "Ferrothorn", ...],
)
```

There's also `predict_lead_from_state(state: UniversalState)` which takes a parsed replay state directly.

Lead selection can use either **argmax** (deterministic) or **multinomial sampling** from the predicted distribution (controlled by `use_argmax`).

### Where it's used

| Consumer | How it uses TeamPreviewModel |
|---|---|
| **RL evaluation** (`metamon/rl/evaluate/__main__.py`) | At the start of each evaluation battle, the model predicts the lead from the team preview state |
| **Standalone training** (`python -m metamon.backend.team_preview.preview`) | The module can be run directly with CLI arguments to train a new model |

**Further reading:** The model definition and training loop are in `metamon/backend/team_preview/preview.py`. The `PokemonTokenizer` (which maps species/move/ability/item names to integer tokens) is defined in `metamon/tokenizer.py`. The `consistent_pokemon_order()` and `consistent_move_order()` sorting utilities are in `metamon/interface.py`. The `CrossAttentionBlock` and `SelfAttentionBlock` used by the model are in `metamon/il/model.py`.

# Tricky battle mechanics that cause parsing headaches

Several Pokémon battle mechanics are notoriously difficult to parse correctly from spectator logs. When working on the parser, watch out for these:

### Zoroark / Zorua (Illusion)
Zoroark disguises itself as the last Pokémon in the party. The spectator sees the disguise's species in `|switch|` and `|move|` messages. When Illusion breaks, Showdown emits `|replace|POKEMON|DETAILS|HP` — the parser must rewind to before the illusion started, restore the disguise Pokémon's original state, and transfer newly-discovered moves/items/abilities from the disguise window to the real Zoroark. The backward pass (`_resolve_zoroark`) fixes action targets that pointed to the disguise and copies Zoroark's real moveset to the disguise Pokémon for action validation. Replays with Zoroark are flagged with `WarningFlags.ZOROARK` and have relaxed validation.

### Foreign-summoned moves (Metronome, Sleep Talk, etc.)
`MOVE_OVERRIDE` moves (Metronome, Mirror Move, Copycat, Assist, Nature Power, Me First, Magic Coat, Snatch) call random or opponent moves that the user does **not** actually know. The parser must suppress these from being added to `had_moves`. `MOVE_OVERRIDE_BUT_REVEAL_ANYWAY` (Sleep Talk) is the exception — it draws from the user's own moveset, so the revealed move IS a real move. The parser uses `pending_foreign_move` to track cross-turn foreign move sequences and suppress follow-up turns.

### Consecutive / multi-turn moves (Outrage, Thrash, Petal Dance, Rollout, etc.)
`CONSECUTIVE_MOVES` lock the user in for 2–3 turns. When called by Metronome, the parser must suppress all turns. The flag `pending_foreign_move` with a charge-move counter (`_pending_foreign_charge_remaining`) handles the nested case of foreign-called charge moves (e.g. Metronome → Solar Beam).

### Gen 1 PP rollover
Partial trapping moves (Wrap, Bind, Fire Spin, Clamp) in Gen 1 cause PP to roll over from 0 to 63 after the first use — a well-known RBY bug. The parser handles this with `GEN1_PP_ROLLOVERS` and a special `pp_used = -63` assignment.

### Transform and Mimic
Transform copies the opponent's species, types, stats, and moves. The parser tracks `transformed_into` and `transformed_this_turn`. During backward fill, `_resolve_transforms` propagates moves the transformed opponent had back through the transformation window, so the dataset sees a full moveset. Mimic temporarily copies one move; `PEEffect.MIMIC` and `|-start|` / `|-activate|` messages reveal which move was copied. Both Transform and Mimic can cause movesets to exceed 4 moves, which is handled with truncation at the interface level.

### Forced switches (U-turn, Volt Switch, Eject Button, Red Card, Roar, Dragon Tail, Revival Blessing, etc.)
When a move or item forces a switch, the parser creates a **subturn** — a frozen mid-turn state where the forced switch action happens. Subturns must be matched with actual switch-in messages. Edge cases where the forced switch *fails* (e.g. U-turn into Protect, Volt Switch blocked by Lightning Rod) leave unfilled subturns that produce warnings but don't crash the parser.

### Skill Swap and ability overwriting
Abilities that overwrite other abilities (Lingering Aroma, Mummy, Wandering Spirit) require care with `[from] ability: [of]` message parsing. Skill Swap can fail against certain abilities (Wonder Guard, Multitype, Illusion, etc.). The parser has an explicit list (`SKILL_SWAP_FAILS`) but the failure case raises `ForwardException("Detected Skill Swap failure with patch TODO")` — it's not fully handled.

### Item manipulation (Trick, Switcheroo, Thief, Covet, Knock Off, Fling)
Trick and Switcheroo swap items — tracked via `pokemon.tricking`. Thief and Covet steal from a named target. Knock Off and Fling remove the target's item. Corrosive Gas is also in `ITEM_APPROVED_SKIP`. The `[from] move: [of] pokemon` messages in `|-item|` / `|-enditem|` must be carefully parsed to determine whose item changed.

### Choice messages with numeric format
When `|choice|` uses numeric format (`move 1`, `switch 3`), the parser currently **cannot** use it because the mapping from numbers to specific move/switch names is unknown without the Showdown request messages (which are only present in the online env, not in raw replays). Only named choices (`move Ice Beam`) are processed.

**Further reading:** The `_parse_choice` method in `metamon/backend/replay_parser/forward.py` shows the current (limited) choice handling logic. The `_parse_move` method (~300 lines) is where all the special-case move handling lives — study the [from] effect parsing, `MOVE_OVERRIDE` suppression, and `pending_foreign_move` tracking. The `_parse_replace` method handles Zoroark. All known exception types are catalogued in `metamon/backend/replay_parser/exceptions.py` — grep for any exception class name to find where it's raised. The `check_forward_consistency` and `check_forced_switching` functions in `checks.py` enforce invariants and often surface edge cases that weren't handled. Specific tricky replays: Gen 1 Wrap/Bind PP rollover battles, any Gen 9 replay with Revival Blessing, and replays containing Zoroark or Ditto (Transform) — search `$METAMON_CACHE_DIR/parsed-replays/` for files that triggered `WarningFlags` by checking the parser's error history.
